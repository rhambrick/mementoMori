# 💀

A minimalist countdown clock that reminds you life is short — a modern *memento mori*.  
Enter your birthdate once, and it will display the estimated number of seconds you have left to live. 

There are 3 versions: a command line version written in C, a desktop GUI version in Python, and a web app version hosted [here](https://rhambrick.github.io/mementoMori/).
The command line will tick as you build the program.
The desktop GUI floats silently on your screen in red text with a black background. Move the widget where you need.
The web app does the same within the browser (storing your info in browser only). Note: the reset button is hidden and on mobile you need to click a few lines below the timer to reset DOB should you need to. On desktop the button shows on mouse hover.
